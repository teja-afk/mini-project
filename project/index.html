                <h2>Harmful Components of E-Waste</h2>
                <p>
                    Electronic waste, or e-waste, contains various harmful components that can have detrimental effects on the environment and human health if not disposed of properly. Here are some of the key components and their effects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lead:</strong> Found in CRT monitors and some circuit boards, lead exposure can result in neurological and developmental issues, especially in children.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mercury:</strong> Commonly found in fluorescent lamps and batteries, mercury can harm the nervous system, kidneys, and the environment when it enters water bodies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cadmium:</strong> Found in rechargeable batteries, cadmium is a carcinogen and can cause lung and prostate cancer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hexavalent Chromium:</strong> Present in some electronics, it's a carcinogen and can also harm the respiratory system and skin.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polybrominated Flame Retardants:</strong> Used in plastics and circuit boards, these can disrupt hormones and potentially lead to developmental issues.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Proper e-waste disposal and recycling are essential to prevent these toxic components from leaching into the environment and posing health risks. Recycling e-waste helps recover valuable materials and reduces the burden on landfills.
